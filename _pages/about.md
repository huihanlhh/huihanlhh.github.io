Hi, my name is Huihan Li. I'm a second-year M.S.E student studying Computer Science in Princeton University. I'm part of the [Princeton Natural Language Processing Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/), advised by [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). I studied Computer Science and Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/), working with [Christine Bassem](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs/faculty/bassem) on human crowdsensing.

I am passionate about Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and everything about languages. In high school, I competed in [International Linguistics Olympiad](https://ioling.org/) representing China.

Outside of research, I enjoy all kinds of sports, cooking/baking, and reading.


Research
======
My research focuses on building agents that genuinely (or seemingly) understand natural languages. As of now, I am especially interested in question answering, instruction tuning, natural language understanding, text generation, etc.

Ongoing and finished projects include:
*  **Conversational Question Answering** - re-evaluating the current evaluation protocol for Conversational Question Answering models
*  **Instruction Understanding** - training seq2seq models to understand natural language instructions
