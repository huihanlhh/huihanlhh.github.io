Hi, my name is Huihan Li. I'm a second year PhD student working on Natural Language Processing in University of Southern California. I'm part of the [INK Lab](https://inklab.usc.edu/), advised by [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/). I got my M.S.E in Computer Science from Princeton University, being part of the [Princeton Natural Language Processing Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/) and advised by [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). I studied Computer Science and Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/), working with [Christine Bassem](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs/faculty/bassem) on human crowdsensing.

I am passionate about Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and everything about languages. In high school, I competed in [International Linguistics Olympiad](https://ioling.org/) representing China.

Outside of research, I enjoy all kinds of sports, cooking/baking, and reading.


Research
======
My research focuses on training and evaluating language models using tasks that require mastering knowledge of the world. As of now, I am especially interested in robust natural language understanding, generation following constraints, and question answering.
