As a PhD student in Computer Science, I spend lots of hours sitting and typing in front of the screen, probably in very bad postures. I also happen to love sports. As a result, over the years I have been a frequent visitor to Physical Therapists, and have developed a somewhat systematic understanding of bodily pain while learning to manage them.

I created this 10-min crash course on how to understand and self-diagnose some of the common symptoms office workers like us tend to develop: neck, lower back and knee pain. Hopefully, when PT is not available to you, this course can help you get started on managing your pain.
